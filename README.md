# Enhanced Intrusion Detection System Using Deep Neural Network
A IDS is created using Deep Neural Network Model with a Packet Analyzing Script Powered by Scapy. The Model makes decisions using a API Script that receives all the real time packet data sent by the Packet Analyzer.

## Key Achievements
•	Designed and Implemented a DNN-based IDS to mitigate Network Security risks.
•	Reduced False Positive Rate and achieved a detection accuracy rate of 97%.
•	Preprocessed and Analyzed data for training the DNN Model.
•	Developed using TensorFlow and Flask Frameworks with Scapy powered by Python.

## Submission
Submitted as the Final Project to Ravensbourne University, London (Masters in Computer Science Program).
